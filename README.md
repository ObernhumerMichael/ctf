# 🚩 CTF Write-ups & Solutions

Welcome!
This repository is a collection of my solutions, scripts, and thought processes for various **Capture The Flags**.
I use this space to document my learning journey in cybersecurity and to keep a library of reusable "one-liners" and exploits.

> **Note:** These write-ups are intended for educational purposes only. Always play fair and respect the "No spoilers while the CTF is live" rule.
